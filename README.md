# Kernel

A simple bare-metal OS written in Rust. It includes drawing primitive shapes to a 320x200 256-color VGA screen.
Very much not finished, still some major bugs.
Everything except for `graphics` was from following the Philipp Oppermann [blog_os](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os).
Can be run on QEMU.
